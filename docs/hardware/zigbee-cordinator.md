# Zigbee Coordinator

My good friend Devin made the mistake of introducing me to [this little piece](https://www.tubeszb.com/product/cc2652_poe_coordinator/21) of technology.

This is a network attached device that coordinates your zigbee devices. It's got a cute management panel and it intergrates nicely with [zigbee2mqtt](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/) which is running [inside my cluster](https://kami.gg/cluster). It's super simple to learn how to add devices, but not as easy as updating them (its a whole 'nother world).
